# Example App for Networking

I made this app as a quick example of an express HTTP server with use of a database. It is a simple app that just lets you comment on the webpage.

This project is by no means perfect and features many issues that should be addressed.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
1. Run `npm install`
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
    - `PORT` - The port you want the server to run on
    - `MONGDB_URI` - The URI to your MongoDB database
1. Run `npm start`
